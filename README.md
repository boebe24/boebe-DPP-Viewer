### Usage of AI
*GitHub Copilot* was used to generate parts of the Kotlin Documentation (KDoc).

The `setUpCertificate` function in the `AppUtilTest` class, which creates an X.509 certificate from a PEM file, was also generated by *GitHub Copilot*

In the `fetchTextFromUrlAsString` function in the `AppUtil` class, our HTTPS request is disguised as a request from a browser. The part of codes that adds the browser headers was generated by *Claude*.

*ChatGPT-4o* was used to generate the `analyzeQRCode()` method, which can detect QR Codes in a Bitmap.
